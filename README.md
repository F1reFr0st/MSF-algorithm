# Modified Structure Function (MSF) algorithm

## Where MSF is used?
Dynamic speckle imaging (DSI) enables visualization of speed distribution for processes that occur in a controlled object and lead to micro-changes of its relief. 
Method is used in such fields as non-destructive testing, estimation of blood flow, measurement of bacterial response, observation of processes in plants,
food quality assessment, drying of paints, fire detection and etc.<br/>
Images that show activity distribution within controlled object are called ***activity maps***. Below are shown some examples.
